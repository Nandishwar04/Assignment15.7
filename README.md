##  How to Run the Full-Stack App

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run seed        # Optional: Seed initial job data
npm run dev         # Starts the backend server on http://localhost:5000
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start           # Starts the React app on http://localhost:3000
```

Make sure MongoDB is running locally at `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`.

##  Technical Approach

### 1. Full-Stack Job Board (React + Node + MongoDB)

- **Backend**: Built with Express.js and connected to MongoDB using Mongoose. Three core APIs are implemented:
  - `GET /api/jobs` — list all jobs
  - `GET /api/jobs/:id` — get job detail by ID
  - `POST /api/applications` — submit job application
- **Database Models**: Two Mongoose schemas — `Job` and `Application`
- **Frontend**: Built using React with TypeScript and React Router.
  - `Home.tsx` lists jobs using Axios
  - `JobPage.tsx` displays job details and application form
  - Styled using inline CSS for clean and responsive design
- **Form Submission**: Application data is posted to backend and stored in MongoDB
- **Testing**: Thunder Client was used to test API calls, and MongoDB Compass to inspect saved applications

### 2. AI Prompt Engineering for SaaS Sales Assistant

- Defined a **system prompt** setting the tone and goal of the AI assistant
- Created **3 reusable prompt templates**:
  1. Cold Call Introduction
  2. Objection Handling (pricing concerns)
  3. Closing Prompt
- Performed **iterative testing** on each template
  - Included original prompt, improved version, and rationale
- Wrote a short **reflection** on what makes a prompt effective
