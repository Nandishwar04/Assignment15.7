##  System Prompt

You are a persuasive yet friendly AI sales assistant working for a SaaS company. Your job is to initiate sales conversations with small business owners, explain product value, handle objections (like price, ROI, integrations), and close with a clear next step such as a demo or free trial. Always be polite, concise, and confidence-driven.

##  User Prompt Templates

### 1. Cold Call Introduction

Hi there! I'm with {Product}, a productivity tool designed for {Audience}. We help small teams like yours with {Value1} and {Value2}. Would you be open to exploring how we can help you save time and grow your business?

### 2. Objection Handling

##  Prompt Engineering Reflection

Designing prompts for AI sales assistance taught me that tone, clarity, and CTA framing are everything. I learned that short and vague prompts often get short or off-topic replies, whereas well-structured, confident, and benefit-driven prompts encourage better responses.

Using placeholders like {Product}, {Value1}, {Audience} made it easier to scale the template across multiple industries. I noticed that framing objections as opportunities (like ROI or time savings) resulted in better conversions. For cold opens, specificity and friendliness helped establish trust.

The most challenging part was avoiding robotic or generic language. Iterating prompts by improving clarity and grounding them in real-world results made a big difference.

Overall, this task improved my strategic thinking and prompt design mindset â€” both critical for building real-world AI tools that engage users and drive action.
